\usage{
Current_CRISPR_algos(algo_call, py_path = NULL,
  jacks_target_genes = NULL, jacks_n_iter = 5,
  jacks_reference_library = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{algo_call}{Which algorithm to use, can take one or all. Accepted values c("drugZ", "BAGEL", "JACKS")}

\item{py_path}{(optional) python path to use}

\item{jacks_target_genes}{A vector of gene names to run JACKS on if not all genes are required. Default NULL (all genes will be used).}

\item{jacks_n_iter}{An integer number of iterations of JACKS inference performed. Default 5.}

\item{jacks_reference_library}{Name of the gRNA library to be used in inference ("avana","gecko2","yusa_v1o", or the path to a local grna results file). If this is specified, gRNA efficacies are not estimated, which greatly speeds up the computation. Default NULL (recalculate gRNA efficacies).}

\item{...}{Other optional params to pass to either drugZ, BAGEL or JACKS}
}
\value{
Returns specfic results for either drugZ, BAGEL or JACKS
}
\description{
This function allows the user to call current CRISPR algorithms to analyze their data, it includes drugZ, BAGEL and JACKS
drugZ (python3: <https://github.com/hart-lab/drugz>) and BAGEL (python2: <https://github.com/hart-lab/bagel>) are two python scripts,
developed in the Hart lab <http://www.hart-lab.org>.
drugZ is used to rank the resistant and sensitive genes comparing a treated sample to non-treated sample, returning a normalzied Z-score.
BAGEL using a bayesian approach to identify essential and non-essential genes.
JACKS (<https://github.com/felicityallen/JACKS/tree/master/2018_paper_materials>) is implemented in R and python, used for the inference of essentiallity
of genes from one or many CRISPR screens taking into account largely on how well each guide performs. JACKS was developed in the Parts Group at Sanger Institute.
